/// [Trace] allows you to set the beginning and end of a custom trace in your app.
///
/// A trace is a report of performance data associated with some of the
/// code in your app. You can have multiple custom traces, and it is
/// possible to have more than one custom trace running at a time. Each custom
/// trace can have multiple metrics and attributes added to help measure
/// performance related events. A trace also measures the time between calling
/// `start()` and `stop()`.
///
/// Data collected is automatically sent to the associated Firebase console
/// after stop() is called.
///
/// You can confirm that Performance Monitoring results appear in the Firebase
/// console. Results should appear within 12 hours.
///
/// It is highly recommended that one always calls `start()` and `stop()` on
/// each created [Trace] to not avoid leaking on the platform side.
